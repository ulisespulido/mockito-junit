Exercise done in java community


There are missing features to be implemented so do them!

a) As a contact list administrator I would like to have a way of viewing all contacts I have added to the contact list.

b) As a contact list administrator I would like to have a way of editing a contact from the contact list.

c) As a contact list administrator I would like to have a way of deleting a contact from the contact list.


Use the existing code base as a sample, also you can improve the code by adding validation functionality to the existing code
